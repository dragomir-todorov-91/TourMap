materialSkeleton
================
This Project was build with the Android Studio RC 1 
(by the time I uploaded this, it was available in the canary channel: 
http://tools.android.com/download/studio/canary )


I needed to create an empty Android Project which uses an Android 5 Toolbar and a Navigation Drawer. 
It should be downwards compatible down to the Android API 15

This Skeleton does exactly fit that purpose.


If you want to use it, just clone the repository, rename the project and its Application ID and use it for your purpose.

Push-Requests are welcome!

Best regards!
